## P01 - Shell Project - Commands Package.
### Caleb Sneath
### Description:

This folder contains the shell commands package. It contains the files for the functions themselves, as well as the files to make use of the package as a whole. Each command has its own documentation going further in depth. The most important two files on their own own are the "__init__.py" file and the "commandsTable.py" file. These help the program find all necessary files, as well as code facilitating their use in a shell.
